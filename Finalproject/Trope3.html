		<h2>Science Fiction.</h2>

		<p>Science Fiction which is popularly called Sci-fi deals with futuristic concept that mostly include advanced science and technology. Even with the advanced science and technology, Sci-fi books don't potray earth as a peace filled place but more as what is left after the human atrocities have eaten away part of human life. </p>

		<p>One would think that the imagined future of humans might be peaceful but it's not and that is one of the reasons I love sci-fi. Not saying I'm anti-peace or anything, it's just reading about the steps the protagonist takes to make earth a better place in an age of advancement is facinating.</p>

		<p>So the tropes under this genre of fiction inlcude:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span>Alternate Universes:</span> This trope can also be seen in fantasy novels but is predominant in sci-fi books. To create a book that fits into this trope, all you'll need is a separate universe that coexists with ours but is totally different from it and your alternate universe creation is half done. All you'll need next is a good plot.</li>
			<li><span>Post-Apocalyptic Tropes:</span> These are mostly post-apocalyptic dystopian Novels. These novels consist of how earth could be if something very life changing hapens to the earth and wipes millions of people leaving those who remain fighting for their lives from world leaders that aren't in their favor.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Below are book recommendations for the tropes above:</p>
