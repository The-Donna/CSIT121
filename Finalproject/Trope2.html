		<h2>Fantasy Fiction.</h2>

		<p>The Fantsy Genre can be said to be my most read fiction genre ever because fantasy novels take me to a different time, place and reality in the world. It serves as a great escape from the norm and it has special place in my heart for that reason. Under the fantsy genre, there are several supernaturals so I'll be talking about the supernaturals as one.</p>

		<p>There is one recurring trope under this genre and it's <span>"Soulmates"</span>. Different supernatural creatures in this trope call them different things. Vampires call them beloveds, werewolves call them mates, and so on.</p>

		<p>The concept of a soulmate is an individual who was chosen for you and is your perfect match who can be found by smell, touch, and others. </p>

		<p>The second recurring trope is the <span>"Chosen One"</span>. In this trope there is an individual, make or female that is destined to save a specie from total annihilation. It is that characters responsibilty to save the plots main conflict.</p>

		<p>Below are book recommendations for the tropes above:</p>
