	<p> One thing about me is I am always listening to music and if I'm not, I randomly start singing at any time and in any situation. I can proudly say that my friends are totally tired of me by now but it's ok, they love me regardless.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, I currently have no favorite song but I can confidently say I am a lover of almost all genres (almost because I
	 cannot stand rock). Even if I dont like a genre, there most likely be a song that I like.</p>

	<p>The link to two of my favorite playlists on spotify is:<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Ok3ZhaEFg4292ciFJ4Zgk?si=8f4d272b2b6c4def">For African Songs</a>and<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6BjBSDDIQgJDzmf7YTlPuL?si=cf549298bb904e63">For Mostly American Songs</a></p>
