		<h2>What Are Tropes?</h2>

			<p>Tropes are recurrent themes in works of art. In novels tropes are the themes the authors make use of in their books. It would do one good to know that some tropes are peculiar to a genre while others span multiple genres. It would also be important to note that while some genres are totally reliant on tropes, there are a good number that do not rely on tropes or do not have a recurrent theme that is known across board.</p>

			<p>There are almost 300 tropes out there so I'll only be talking about tropes peculiar to different genres.</p>

			<p>Enjoyyyy!!!!!</p>
