		<h2>Romance.</h2>

		<p>Romance houses the most tropes, ranging from Enemies-to-Lovers to Fake Relationships. So I'm going to be talking about my two favorite tropes under the romance genre and they are the billionaire and Mafia trope.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span>Billionaire Tropes:</span> These tropes are known for their ridiculously rich male leads and the struggling female counterparts. The ridiculously rich male leads mostly own multi-million dollar companies and the women mostly are new workers in said company. They are always ridiculously cute and serve as good palette cleansers after reading very emotional novels.</li>
			<li><span>Mafia Tropes:</span> To be honest , it's the intruige of being on the wrong side of the law and also the violence that makes me love this trope. There are so many lovels that have my heart that belong to this trope.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are my favorites but I still have a few that I love. Below are book recommendations for the tropes above:</p>
