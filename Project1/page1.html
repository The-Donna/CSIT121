	<h2>Hello, It's Gloria. How you doing!!</h2>

	<p> I am not really a fan of talking about myself but this would have to do.</p>

	<p>I love a wide range of things but I'll be talking about three main things I love. They are; Music, Novels and Movies.</p>

	<p>I cherish a couple of things and I would say the most important are my siblings, closely followed by my friends. I would say that I have come to like this class enough to actually make the top of my best classes list✌️.</p>
