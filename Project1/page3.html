	<p>Those who know me well would say that my love for novels is admirable. Reading novels give me a lot of joy and peace and novels provoke more emotion from me than people do (that sounded wrong but it's true)</p>

	<p>My problem with my love for novels is that I am a very fast reader so it doesn't take me long to start looking for a new book. Like every other novel reader, I love physical books. Unfortunately, I don't have that type of money yet, but below is a picture of my online book library.</p>
